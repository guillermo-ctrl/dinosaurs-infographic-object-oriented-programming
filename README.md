This app takes user input to generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, only the name of the human will be displayed. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed are random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts. One of the titles is for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”


Some of the starting code was supplied by Udacity.
